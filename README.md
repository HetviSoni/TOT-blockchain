We all as a student have once in a while felt demotivated that even after solving many Data structures and algorthmic questions on various platforms, the material output is not that inspiring, the goodies or rewards from the various platforms are either very hard to achieve, or take a very long time to meet the requirements. Also there is no way to get rewarded for the overall question solved across various platforms.

The goal of the project was to develop an application using Web2 and Blockchain towards achieving the goal of tokenization of talent. The concept is to reward the student for solving Data Structures and algorithms questions on various platforms. While awarding students, we take into consideration the time taken to solve a particular question and the number of previously solved questions. As we are already having records of students, the hiring process for different companies will be more easy.

We have created ERC20 tokens called fraggers. It is hosted on the local ethereum test net. On the basis of problems solved by the students we will transfer these tokens into their accounts.These records would also be helpful for different companies that want to hire students. It would reduce time and effort in their hiring process.
